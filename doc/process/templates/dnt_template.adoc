xtUML Project Design Note

NOTE:  Each section has a description that states the purpose of that section.
Delete these section descriptions before checking in your note.  Delete this
note as well.

== 1 Abstract

In this section, give a summary of the design that this note aims to
describe.

TIP:  This document is marked down with http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc].
You can get tips from the
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Quick Reference].

== 2 Introduction and Background

In this section, outline the important points relating to this issue/bug that
the reader would need to know in order to understand the rest of this
document. Here is an example reference to a document reference <<dr-3>>.
Here is an example with named text <<dr-3,SMASL Specification>>.
Here we refer to the image below, <<caption text under image>>.

.caption text under image

== 3 Requirements

This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note.
If present it describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there
is an SRS, this section may simply refer to it.  Each requirement should be as
short and simple as possible and must be clearly defined.

 Here is some text that
 is not formatted and line-wrapped.  Do this by simply prepending
 a blank to the beginning of each line.

Here we reference a section heading below, like <<3.2.1 Example sub-item>>.

=== 3.1 Item
==== 3.1.1 Example sub-item
Paragraphs can start here.

* example bulleted list item
  - Example Sub list item with example named document reference <<dr-2,Analyze Options for Migration>>

=== 3.2 Section
==== 3.2.1 Example sub-section

1. First Example Numbered List Element
2. Second
  a. enumerated sub first
  b. enumerated sub second
3. third

== 4 Analysis

This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note.


== 5 Design

In this section, describe in detail each step of the Work Required section of
the analysis, how the task will be accomplished, what technologies will
be used, algorithms, etc.

=== 5.1 Item

[source,java]
----
    // java code example
    public void clearDatabase(IProgressMonitor pm) 
    {
        // clear the corresponding graphics-root's database
        OoaofgraphicsUtil.clearGraphicsDatabase(rootId, pm);

        Ooaofooa.getDefaultInstance().fireModelElementUnloaded(this);
    }
----

==== 5.1.1. Example sub-section

== 6 Design Comments

If research carried out during this phase shows that a requirement stated in the
analysis note is infeasible or needs some modification, enumerate those changes
here. If there was no preceding analysis note, then this section documents any
deviations from the design as presented at the design review.

.Recommended Type Mapping
[options="header"]
|===
| MASL type  | xtUML type recommendation
| boolean    | Use native `boolean`
| byte       | Create UDT with core type `integer`
| character  | Create UDT with core type `integer`
|===


== 7 User Documentation

Describe the end user documentation that was added for this change.

== 8 Unit Test

Outline all the unit tests that need to pass and describe the method that you
will use to design and perform the tests.


== 9 Document References

In this section, list all the documents that the reader may need to refer to.
Give the full path to reference a file.
