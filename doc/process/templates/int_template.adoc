xtUML Project Implementation Note

NOTE:  Each section has a description that states the purpose of that section.
Delete these section descriptions before checking in your note.  Delete this
note as well.

== 1 Abstract

In this section, give a summary of the design that this note aims to
describe.

TIP:  This document is marked down with http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc].
You can get tips from the
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Quick Reference].

== 2 Introduction and Background

In this section, outline the important points relating to this issue/bug that
the reader would need to know in order to understand the rest of this
document. Here is an example reference to a document reference <<dr-3>>.
Here is an example with named text <<dr-3,SMASL Specification>>.
Here we refer to the image below, <<caption text under image>>.

== 3 Requirements

This section is only required if there is no preceding design note.
If present it describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there
is an SRS, this section may refer to it.  Each requirement should be as short
and simple as possible and must be clearly defined.

 Here is some text that
 is not formatted and line-wrapped.  Do this by simply prepending
 a blank to the beginning of each line.

Here we reference a section heading below, like <<3.2.1 Example sub-item>>.

=== 3.1 Item
==== 3.1.1 Example sub-item
Paragraphs can start here.

* example bulleted list item
  - Example Sub list item with example named document reference <<dr-2,Analyze Options for Migration>>

=== 3.2 Section
==== 3.2.1 Example sub-section

1. First Example Numbered List Element
2. Second
  a. enumerated sub first
  b. enumerated sub second
3. third

== 4 Work Required

Elaborate on each point of the Work Required section of the design note and
describe how you implemented each step.  If there is no design note, this
section, breaks out the consequential work (as a numbered list) needed to
meet the requirements specified in the Requirements section.

== 5 Implementation Comments

If the design cannot be implemented as written or if it needs some
modification, enumerate the changes to the design in this section.
If there was no preceding design note, then this section documents
any deviations from the implementation as presented at the
pre-implementation engineering review.

.Recommended Type Mapping
[options="header"]
|===
| MASL type  | xtUML type recommendation
| boolean    | Use native `boolean`
| byte       | Create UDT with core type `integer`
| character  | Create UDT with core type `integer`
|===

=== 5.1 Item 1

[source,java]
----
    // java code example
    public void clearDatabase(IProgressMonitor pm)
    {
        // clear the corresponding graphics-root's database
        OoaofgraphicsUtil.clearGraphicsDatabase(rootId, pm);

        Ooaofooa.getDefaultInstance().fireModelElementUnloaded(this);
    }

==== 5.1.1 Example sub-item

== 6 Unit Test

Outline all the unit tests that need to pass and describe the method that you
will use to design and perform the tests.

. Here is another ordered list element allowing the renderer to do the work.
  This may be better for unit test steps that do not get explicitly referenced.
. second one
  .. enumerated sub first
  .. enumerated sub second
. third

== 7 User Documentation

Describe the end user documentation that was added for this change.

== 8 Code Changes
